## Artefact

How to Read Donald Duck (Spanish: Para leer al Pato Donald) is a 1971 book-length essay by Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart that critiques Disney comics from a Marxist point of view as being vehicles for American cultural imperialism. It was first published in Chile in 1971, became a bestseller throughout Latin America and is still considered a seminal work in cultural studies. It was reissued in August 2018 to a general audience in the United States, with a new introduction by Dorfman, by OR Books.

There is an illustration of the USA, personified into a Donald Duck character taking shovels of gold coins from the national banks of South America. The title is written in a red bold comic font, and some quotes of praise are written over the cover. The paper is worn out through the passing of time, becoming yellowish and having some brown spots throughout.


## Research

![https://github.com/IanScheu/HowToReadDonaldDuck/blob/master/howtoreaddonaldduck/Untitled%201.png](https://github.com/IanScheu/HowToReadDonaldDuck/blob/master/howtoreaddonaldduck/Untitled%201.png)

The book's thesis is that Disney comics are not only a reflection of the prevailing ideology at the time capitalism, but that they are also aware of this, and are active agents in spreading the ideology. To do so, Disney comics use images of the everyday world:

"Here lies Disney's inventive (product of his era), rejecting the crude and explicit scheme of adventure strips, that came up at the same time. The ideological background is without any doubt the same: but Disney, not showing any open repressive force, is much more dangerous. The division between Bruce Wayne and Batman is the projection of fantasy outside the ordinary world to save it. Disney colonizes the everyday world, at hand of ordinary man and his common problems, with the analgesic of a child's imagination".

This closeness to everyday life is so only in appearance, because the world shown in the comics, is based on ideological concepts, resulting in a set of natural rules that lead to the acceptance of particular ideas about capital, the developed countries' relationship with the third world, gender roles, etc.

## Publication Context

How to Read Donald Duck was written and published during the brief flowering of revolutionary socialism under the government of Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity coalition and is closely identified with the revolutionary politics of its era. In 1973, a coup d'état, secretly supported by the United States, brought in power the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. During Pinochet's regime, How to Read Donald Duck was banned and subject to book burning; its authors were forced into exile.

Outside Chile, HtRDD became the most widely printed political text in Latin America for some time.

### Chilean Dictatorship

In 1969 a cluster of Chilean parties and left-wing groups formed the Popular Unity (Unidad Popular) coalition, proposing as its presidential candidate **Salvador Allende Gossens**, a Socialist and an avowed Marxist; he was elected president in 1970.

The Popular Unity program looked forward to the eventual transition to socialism, which was to be accomplished through the end of domination of mining and finance by foreign capital, expanded agrarian reform, and more equal distribution of income favouring the poorer classes. The accomplishments of this program were responsible for the advance of Popular Unity in the municipal elections of 1971 and in the congressional elections of 1973.

Between 1970 and 1972, however, toleration of the Popular Unity government by the middle class declined as a consequence of difficulties in the economy, which featured a complex and not always consistent reorganization resulting from the nationalization of U.S.-owned copper mines (the main resource of economic production) and of a number of heavy industries. Difficulties in maintaining production levels were further augmented by boycotts on the side of foreign capital, mainly American, and the reduction of agricultural production as a consequence of agrarian reform. Inflation and stagnation of production were propitious to the growth and regrouping of the forces that opposed the socialist experiment. The oligarchy, the right-wing National Party, and the centre Christian Democrats finally joined their efforts and supported the antigovernment trends in the armed forces.

On September 11, 1973, the armed forces staged a coup d’état. Allende died during an assault on the presidential palace, and a junta composed of three generals and an admiral, with **General Augusto Pinochet** Ugarte as president, was installed. At the outset the junta received the support of the oligarchy and of a sizable part of the middle class. This support by moderate political forces, including many Christian Democrats, can be explained by their belief that a dictatorship represented a transitional stage necessary to restoring the status quo as it had been before 1970. Very soon they were to concede that the military officers in power had their own political objectives, including the repression of all left-wing and centre political forces. The Christian Democratic, National, and Radical Democracy parties were declared to be in “indefinite recess,” and the Communists, Socialists, and Radicals were proscribed. In 1977 the traditional parties were dissolved, and a private enterprise economy was instated.

The policies of the military government, though encouraging the development of free enterprise and a new entrepreneurial class, caused unemployment, a decline of real wages, and, as a consequence, a worsening of the standard of living of the lower and middle classes. Political and social conditions were complicated by a developing international economic crisis. All of that combined with repression and censorship on culture that strayed away from the military's values. Leading to massive book burnings, which included the book How to Read Donald Duck.

### Salvador Allende

Allende's Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States. But when Chile nationalized its copper industry, Washington cut off United States credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the Soviet Union to invest some $400 million in Chile in the next six years. Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the USSR than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment.

This is an exerpt from one of his UN speeches where he sheds some light into the exploration that the Chilean population had been put through by the United States:

> "*I come from Chile, a small country but one where today any citizen is free to express himself as he so desires. A country of unlimited cultural, religious and ideological tolerance and where there is no room for racial discrimination. A country with its working class united in a single trade union organization, where universal and secret sufrage is the vehicle of determination of a multiparty regime, with a Parliament that has been operating constantly since it was created 160 years ago; where the courts of justice are independent of the executive and where the constitution has only been changed once since 1833, and has almost always been in effect. A country where public life is organized in civilian institutions and where the armed forces are of a proven professional background and deep democratic spirit. A country with a population of almost 10,000,000 people that in one generation has had two first-place Nobel Prize winners in literature, Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda, both children of simple workers. In my country, history, land and man are united in a great national feeling.

But Chile is also a country whose retarded economy has been subjected and even alienated to foreign capitalists firms, resulting in a foreign debt of more than US$ 4,000 million whose yearly services represent more than 30 per cent of the value of the country's exports; whose economy is extremely sensitive to the external situation, suffering from chronic stagnation and inflation; and where millions of people have been forced to live amidst conditions of exploitation and misery, of open or concealed unemployment."*

Allende was in some ways very forward thinking in the way he tried to implement the presence of the state in many facets of Chilean society. For some years during his presidency he tried to implement what was called project Cybersyn which was a Chilean project from 1971 to 1973  aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.

Project Cybersyn control room

And this taking control of the means of production was also very important for the publication and distribution of the book HtRDD, since it was printed in Salvador Allende's own press that he would print also the graphic material for his government. This lasted for a few years until he suffered the coup and was subsequently killed. But by then the book was already being disseminated all around the world gaining more and more notoriety in the years to come.

## Disney and the Comic book

### Carl Barks and the creation of Duckburg

> "*A lot of Disney's popularity can be traced back to a single man: Carl Barks. Known for years as "the good duck artist"—for a long time, the only artist credited on Disney comics was Walt Disney himself—Barks wrote and drew around 500 comics starring Donald, his miserly Uncle Scrooge McDuck, and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Some of these were short, 10-page comedy strips that appeared in Walt Disney's Comics & Stories. Others were longer, more straightforward adventure stories, most of which appeared in Barks' quarterly Uncle Scrooge series—which just happened to be the best-selling comic book of the 1960s."*

Comics historian Thomas Andrae has examined the arguments of How to Read Donald Duck and compared them to the actual Disney comic book stories by Carl Barks. One of the arguments featured in the original book is that in the world of Disney no-one has to work in order to produce. The stories feature products which are bought, sold, and consumed. But they do not depict the effort needed for their production. Andrae notes that the writers seem to have identified commodity fetishism in Barks' works. The notion is that the value of products is displaced from the labor that produces them and misconceived as emanating from the products itself. The notion goes back to the works of Karl Marx. Another argument in the original book is that the service sector of the economy is the one primarily depicted in Disney comics. The citizens of Duckburg are depicted working in jobs of this sector, as delivery boys, hairdressers, night watchmen, salespeople, etc. Blue-collar workers are not depicted. The writers argued that the Disney comics present as insignificant the entire realm of industrial production and the working class, despite the fact that these are the real generators of wealth in capitalist society. Andrae thinks these arguments contradict the stories by Barks, where character Donald Duck himself is often featured as an underpaid and alienated worker.

### The Myths we create as Society

Just like the creation of these subliminal messages, most of our preconceptions in society are made up agreements that through the passing of time have solidified into seemingly immutable aspects of how we live. Along my research I saw a comment on a forum about someone mentioning HtRDD as the spiritual sequel to a Roland Barthes book called "Myths", where in each chapter he takes an object or a custom that we consider very much for granted and then speculates and shows proof on how most aspects in society are constructs.

## Transcoding

As I started thinking of transcoding this object I was really drawn to the idea of adapting the comics medium to other contexts, where I could then express more precisely specific facets that the book explains. For me it's always fascinating seeing through these childish and naive visuals of the cartoons only to find serious relevant topics being portrayed in a way that it becomes more accesible to a wider audience that maybe wouldn't read a philosophical book, but a comic on the other hand, can be read by almost anyone.

## Transcoding No. 1 (From bookcover to sculpture)

### Description

This transcoding I started off as a sort of warm-up transcoding that wasn't so deep in conceptual transcoding, but more as a trigger to maybe what I would develop further. I was really drawn to the illustration of the original book cover of the chilean version of the book. It really demonstrates the relation of power between capitalist USA trying to keep in check neighbouring countries under their political influence. A big deal in the context of the cold war. The international version of the book has a much more diggested illustration where it is somewhat over explained, inn my opinion. So it was nice to pay tribute also to this extinct cover, bringing it back to life in another context.

I can relate the image in the cover of the book very much to the story of the horse of Troy. But in this case the horse would be the disney comics, carrying inside the american ideology, targeted to the latin american coutries.

Once I knew I was going to do a sculpture of some element of the book I started abstracting the possible consequences of this coup d'etat that happened in 1973, linking it to the popular revolt that was happening in Chile in 2019. But I soon turned to a somewhat more one-on-one representation of the bookcover, which I believe already carried alot of meaning and would work powerfully as like a monument in a central square of some fictional Disneyland city.

As for the actual making of the model I used Blender and it's modeling tools.

## Transcoding No. 2 (From comic to audio)

### Description

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBEKfEs81_I&feature=emb_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBEKfEs81_I&feature=emb_title)

In this second transcoding experiment I was very much inspired by an episode I stumbled upon my research, where in 1945 the Mayor of New York read the comic strips of a newspaper on the radio during a newspaper strike. Here is an analises of the event by a journalist:

> "But perhaps one of the most interesting and, historically, certainly most memorable uses of the medium arrived in 1945 when then New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia took to the Big Apple airwaves to—not give a speech or even an interview—but to read the newspaper comics to the children of his fair city.
[...]
By reading the comics, he was actually not just providing entertainment for the childrenof his constituents. La Guardia was finding a way to insert himself into the everydaystreet-corner conversations of millions of New Yorkers. I would argue that this, just asmuch as appealing to the children, was key to why this was such a defining moment forthe memory of La Guardia's career. He had understood the social function of comics to its adult readers, and had joined in that discussion. It's the mark of a true populist--to actually understand what's important to people, even the stuff they wouldn't normally
admit to."

To me it was very interesting working in the audio format since you can really play with the intonation to achieve certain nuance and extra meaning in the speeches

## Transcoding No. 3 (Welcome to the Disneyland Club)

### Description

This transcoding emerged from the idea to do a tutorial on how to actually read a Donald Duck comic page. My first was to read the whole book and make notes as to organize the content in my head.

### Method

The idea changed over time, instead of trying to show in the game content from the whole book, I decided to condense them into a 3D environment in the Disneyland Club, a place the authors mention as where the influencial heads of Disney reside. My next step was to storyboard the experience as well as the space.

Still too many elements/rooms. Trimmed down to 3 rooms in the game.
